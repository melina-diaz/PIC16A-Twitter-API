Use `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer **BEARER TOKEN**" **URL**`

url can be like=https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=from:ucla

We need to figure out:
- How to call other things (look at sample code)
- How to turn json to csv
- How to turn the return of ^function above into a saveable form of data
